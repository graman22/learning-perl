# ; semicolons
# {} blocks of code
# Variable names : my $variable_name;
# Package: Modules::Person
# Objects: my $person = Module::Person;
# Constants: CONSTANT_NAME
# Functions: sub function_name{}

# Follow practices for writing highly maintainble code
# Spaces (Vertical and Horizontal), Comments, Naming Conventions, etc.
# #JavaDoc style description for methods
# Follow 30s rule
# Explain constants

# use strict and use warnings (e.g. using @array[index] instead of $array[index] is wrong - this is thrown as a warning)
